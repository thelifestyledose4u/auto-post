# Future ARM64 Build Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the plan for adding comprehensive ARM64 support to the g4f build system.

## Current Status

- **macOS ARM64**: ✅ Supported (native runners)
- **Linux ARM64**: ⏳ Requires ARM64 runners or cross-compilation
- **Windows ARM64**: ⏳ Requires ARM64 runners or cross-compilation

## Implementation Plan for ARM64 Support

### Phase 1: Linux ARM64 (Future Enhancement)
```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/build-packages.yml
build-linux-exe:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include:
        - architecture: x64
          runner: ubuntu-latest
          runner-arch: x86_64
        - architecture: arm64
          runner: buildjet-4vcpu-ubuntu-2204-arm  # ARM64 runners
          runner-arch: aarch64
```

### Phase 2: Windows ARM64 (Future Enhancement)  
```yaml
build-windows-exe:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include:
        - architecture: x64
          runner: windows-latest
          runner-arch: x86_64
        - architecture: arm64  
          runner: windows-latest-arm64  # When available
          runner-arch: arm64
```

### Phase 3: Cross-compilation Support
For environments without native ARM64 runners:
- Use Docker with QEMU emulation
- Configure Nuitka for cross-compilation
- Test compatibility and performance

## Benefits of ARM64 Support

1. **Performance**: Native ARM64 binaries run faster on ARM64 hardware
2. **Compatibility**: Better support for Apple Silicon Macs and ARM64 Linux systems
3. **Future-proofing**: ARM64 adoption is increasing across all platforms

## Testing Requirements

- Verify ARM64 binaries work on actual ARM64 hardware
- Test performance compared to x64 binaries on ARM64 systems
- Ensure compatibility with all g4f features

## Notes

- This is marked as a future enhancement because it requires ARM64 runners or cross-compilation setup
- Current implementation provides a solid foundation for easy expansion
- The build matrix is designed to accommodate additional architectures
